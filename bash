
Creating a full mobile app involves a lot of code and can vary greatly based on the app's functionality. Below is a basic example of a mobile app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Native. This example will create a simple app with a home screen displaying a welcome message and a button to navigate to another screen.

First, make sure you have node.js and npm installed. Then, install expo-cli which simplifies React Native development:

npm install -g expo-cli

Next, create a new React Native project using Expo:

expo init MyApp
cd MyApp

To run your app, you can use Expo's development tools. Run the following command in your project directory:

expo start
